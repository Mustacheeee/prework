## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Tiktok
  - Automatically adjust the page to my preference
  - Able to share the trends to friends
    
bilibili
  - Ad free video app
  - Free to use
    
Snapchat
  - Unique 3D Avatar
  - Deleting old chat

The app I would like to implement a dynamic comment function in tiktok. For example, some of the top comments would be played automatically as the shorts playing. Or users can comment at the certain time point, and the comments would fly through everytime when the short play to that time point. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
